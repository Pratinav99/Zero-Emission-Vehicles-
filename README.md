# Zero-Emission-Vehicles-

## Project Overview
This project, focuses on visualizing data related to incentives for zero-emission vehicles (iZEV) in Canada. Our goal is to uncover patterns and trends in the adoption of zero-emission vehicles across different Canadian provinces, using Tableau for data analysis and visualization.

## Introduction and Background
According to the United Nations Sustainable Transport Conference, the transport sector contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for about 30% in developed countries and 23% globally. Transitioning to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) like battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles can dramatically reduce these emissions. By achieving a 60% share of ZEVs on the road, we could save over 60 billion tons of CO2 by 2050. Electric vehicles (EVs) not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also significantly lower fuel costs compared to gasoline vehicles.

## key issue addressed
in this project is the analysis and visualization of data related to incentives for zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) in Canada to understand patterns and trends in their adoption. This includes examining the distribution of incentive requests across different provinces, identifying leading vehicle manufacturers, and understanding the impact of geographical locations on ZEV sales. The goal is to provide insights that can help promote sustainable transportation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the adoption of zero-emission vehicles in Canada through interactive visualizations. By understanding these trends, policymakers and stakeholders can better promote sustainable transportation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
